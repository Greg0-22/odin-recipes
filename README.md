---May 9, 2022: Before Starting Project---

This project is to create a basic recipe website. At this point, I have reviewed HTML elements and tags. I have experience with HTML5 previously, but mainly work in Python. I hope to build a simple website using as few help resources as possible to start a foundation for applicable developer skills. 

I will demonstrate current skills such as basic HTML usage (i.e. Boilerplate, <img>, <a>, <h1>, and other beginner HTML tags). to create this website.

---May 9, 2022: After Completing Project Recap---

For this project, I have so far added three recipes on three separate pages using exclusively HTML. I used a combination of heading tags, images, lists, and links. I included an anchor tag at the bottom of each recipe page to get back to the home page without using the back button.

Overall, this was a very simple project, but helped me understand the foundational building blocks of a website and also get more accustomed to using Git and making appropriate commit messages. It also highlighted my lack of keyboard and VSCode shortcuts that would have helped speed up the copy and pasting process. Hopefully, I will discover faster ways to add text to VSCode and to edit multiple lines quickly. Next, I will be learning CSS to stylise websites beyond the simplicity of HTML.
