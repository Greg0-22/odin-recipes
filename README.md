---Before Starting Project---

This project is to create a basic recipe website. At this point, I have reviewed HTML elements and tags. I have experience with HTML5 previously, but mainly work in Python. I hope to build a simple website using as few help resources as possible to start a foundation for applicable developer skills. 

I will demonstrate current skills such as basic HTML usage (i.e. Boilerplate, <img>, <a>, <h1>, and other beginner HTML tags). to create this website.
